Unzip the project, and this should create a new folder with the unzipped contents. Visit chrome://extensions and enable developer mode if itâ€™s unticked. Look for the 'load unpacked' option.

Once successfull, to the right of the search bar you'll find a puzzle piece icon which houses all the plugins. Navigate to the one named 'Plugin'.

Exit out of the plugin by clicking somewhere outside of the UI on your screen. You can start it up again by following the same procedure on the puzzle piece icon. This resets the plugin to its default state.


## Starting the Server
Load the unzipped file into an IDE like VSCode (a simple drag and drop). Verify you're in the current directory with a call to `ls`. Among the files should be node.exe Then run `node server.js` and you should see the following output.

##  Login and Analysis
Currently, the plugin is tied to the Canvas websites, but you may optionally remove this line of code in the `manifest.json` file. Then, visit chrome://extensions and refresh the plugin by clicking the winding arrow for the changes to take effect.

With the server running in the background, start up the plugin and navigate to the 'Login' tab. Submit a text file representing your Piazza username, password, and OpenAI API key in 3 seperate lines. Ensure that there are not trailing spaces.

In the 'Analyze' tab, find a suitable post number and number of comments to analyze. Then give a prompt for ChatGPT to consider.

After waiting a few seconds for the response, you'll have the option to download it as a file. You may encounter red text errors below the submit button. If an error occurs relating to credentials, click out of the plugin, start it up again, go to login, and submit the corrected file.
The script being executed is `piazzaScript.py`.

## CSV Analysis
The third tab is curently non-functional, but the script can be tested individually. You are provided `template.csv` and `test.csv`. Execute this using  `python parserScript.py template.csv test.csv`. You may upload the files through the plugin, but the data is lost when the network call finds the python script, so it will produce an error. The first file represnts a list of commands and their expected arguments. These commands are relevant to generating the parameters for the Canvas API calls related to assigning due dates. Any 'x' means that no argument is expected for that column and particular command, n is a number, and everything else is a useful string that describes how to interpret the value. The second file is a dummy file parsed following the template file, where erros are displayed.
