Student 0: <p>One of the most common architectural styles I&#39;ve personally come across is the microservice architecture.  Many IT projects have adopted this style to establish server-to-server or client-to-server communication to transfer data.  In my current work project, we have implemented several standalone services all deployed independently, with its own database.  We have used Spring boot framework and JDK 11 to build the services.  Each service has been created to hold specific data domains and has endpoints to POST/GET/UPDATE/DELETE data.  The services communicate with one another to send or retrieve data from different domains, using JSON.  And since this HTTP protocol method of communication is so widely accepted, we also have clients who have built UI which basically makes calls to the endpoints to display and update data.  I would say that this architectural style is probably the most well known/used.</p>

Student 1: <p>I have worked for some time as a backend engineer and I could relate that the pipes and filters concept seems very close to the microservices architecture where each service acts as a filter for its data and the pipes are data fed into it in a specific format like a JSON. Each service can be replaced by a different one and is independent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inside each service, I could see Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Organization being used as I used Java&#39;s SpringBoot to build them based on OOPS and SOLID principles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also used .Net based web controls earlier in my career where on clicking a button, for example, an event was triggered. This is an example of Event-based, Implicit Invocation in my opinion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Organization based architecture style is the most commonly used, at least in application development.</p>

Student 2: <p>I would say that the &#34;data abstraction and object-oriented organization&#34; style from section 3.2 of the Garlan and Shaw reading is the most common today because of the huge number of programming languages that currently support it. Some modern languages require use of the OO style, such as Java, while others such as Python provide the option to use OO features such as classes without requiring it. However, even in languages in which OO use is optional such as Python I have seen extensive use of OO in my personal experience. In the case of Java, OO is used to hide internal data from parts of the program that have no need to access that data, allowing developers to change that internal data&#39;s representation without having to update other components. Some programs also take advantage of the inheritance supported by OO, such as when Python developers write a service class that inherits from the Thread class, allowing their service to behave and be used as a thread.</p>

Student 3: <p>I would like to assess the popularity of the architectural styles with the help of their application area - or say the type of applications they lend themselves better. So for example under Operating Systems I think the layered approach is the most famous and commonly used style on a certain level of abstraction in that certain components interact with the user, and certain others are wired with the hardware. But again, Operating Systems are sure to utilize other styles as well - for example the various modules written in the components may very well be utilizing the object oriented and data abstraction style for their implementation or any other that suits their needs. Likewise, I would first say that the style is dependent on the requirements - we apply different styles at different level of abstractions of the system. </p>
<p>Now if we talk about the modules of the components I believe the object oriented and data abstraction style took the computer science world by storm a long time ago and I see it be one the most popular architecture styles in this category. Different business entities(objects) have different ways to create, instantiate, access and modify them along sophisticated lines of processing. </p>
<p>At still higher levels of abstraction and under the category of web applications, I believe these days most of the organizations are employing the Service Oriented Architecture. Herein, we have different standalone web-services/micro services serving the processing needs of their clients from their respective servers. There are different protocols for the implementation of SOA architecture like REST, SOAP etc and hence different ways of calling the end points of the services. The services either receive data for processing and storage or it is a request for retrieval or it could even serve as a proxy to other service. Clients include usually the user interface apps that use the data received from the services to manipulate the front end application state. </p>

Student 4: <p>I think that the layered architectural style is commonly used today since there are a lot of advantages of this architectural style and it even integrates the features of other architectural styles, like abstraction since some layered systems inner layers are hidden from all except the adjacent outer layer. Also, since the layers are independent, we can modify the code inside a layer without affecting others. Hence, for example if we want to change the database from an Oracle server to a SQL server, this will impact the database layer but it won’t impact any other layers.</p>
<p>I also think it&#39;s widely used since, as mentioned in the paper by David Garlan and Mary Shaw, the popular OSI model is built upon the layered architecture and the OSI model is commonly used. The layered architecture is also used in many Java frameworks such as Spring, Apache Struts and Grails. </p>

Student 5: I have very limited experience of what architectural styles are most commonly being used, but during my internship over the last summer, I was assigned a project which was using the microservice architecture.<div>I was assigned the task of creating my own microservices using Python and Machine Learning to detect anomalies in the data that has been obtained from the sensors. There were a lot of microservices, so in short, the data obtained from the various sensors (e.g. temperature, pressure, acoustics) was in raw format and there was a data transformation microservice that transformed this data into usable format which was stored in another microservice created using MongoDB, my microservice would access the data and generate an anomaly score for each data point. This data would be accessed by the alarm generating microservice. These services would communicate with one another and send and receive data using JSON, we used REST API calls to GET/POST data.</div><div>We were building an IOT platform for our users and so there were other microservices as well, but this was what I was dealing with mainly. So I believe that microservice architectural style could be one of the most commonly used architectural styles</div>

Student 6: <p>I am not sure which software architectures are most popular right now.  But after reading this week’s materials I definitely recognize the filter and pipe architecture prevalent in many of the ERP system implementations I have worked on.  It is common for modules in these systems to perform batch processing, which take a larger task and breaks it up into sequential steps where data from an upstream process feeds data into a downstream process.  Each process acts like a filter functioning independently as long as it receives the correct inputs, and then produces output that is used for other processes.</p>

Student 7: <p>If I had to choose an architecture style from the readings as the most common, I would go with data abstraction and object oriented organization.  I think that these both are very closely related to component design, which I have had a lot of recent experience with through the MEng program and in my current internship.  At work, we use React (known for its use of component design) for a good portion of our web applications.  Whenever I add a new feature, it&#39;s always been a rule of thumb that if it becomes complicated, it should be its own component.  This keeps things organized and easier to maintain, because if you want to change something about a particular component, you typically won&#39;t have to worry about the change affecting other areas of the application.  I think that this method of software design is common across the industry as well.</p>

Student 8: <p>As a software developer, I believe Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented architecture to be the most typical. Python and Java, the two programming languages we use frequently, both make use of OO concepts. A few of the reasons I believe this architectural style is common is because - Program reuse makes it simple to maintain and raises system quality. Through polymorphism and abstraction, this architecture offers reusability. Furthermore, An object can modify the implementation without impacting its clients since it hides its representation from them. Additionally, designers can break down issues into groups of interacting agents by combining a set of accessing routines with the data they alter. </p>

Student 9: <p>The Event-based architectural style of &#39;implicit invocation&#39; seems to be increasingly common. From GUIs to web applications to industrial or IoT control systems, Events-based programming is on the rise. Two examples are JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js and AWS serverless architectures. In AWS cloud-based systems design, events can be used to broadcast announcements to subscribers via SNS, and in SQS message queuing, events are how distributed software components communicate with each other via polling. Also, events are central to serverless Lambda functions in AWS which will run your code in a cloud-container of your choice in response actions (Event triggers) that you define. Where I work currently, client/server models are being increasingly replaced by such serverless Lambdas, to do things like parsing logs or exporting backups, etc. </p>

Student 10: <p>In today&#39;s world, I think the most commonly used architectural style is the pipes and filters. This architecture is so commonly in any data intensive application. And in every industry these days, data is so abundant that it requires data cleaning, filtering, and transforming. In every job I had so far, there was some project requiring to build a data pipeline of collecting various input data, filtering it, cleaning it, then outputting the data. I would say with the rise of technology, the amount of data will be ever growing and the need for data pipelining (aka pipes and filters) will also continue to grow to understand the data. </p>
<p>As an example, in the financial banking industry, there&#39;s so consumer data (what they spend money on, when, where, etc). These consumer data needs to be aggregated and consolidated into a summarized view so management can see patterns and make business decisions on them, therefore there&#39;s a lot of software projects to create data pipes/filters to process all these data.</p>

Student 11: <p>I think Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Organization is the most common style since most applications nowadays requires identifying and protecting related bodies of information/data. I think mobile phones will be a good example for when we answer incoming calls or respond to text messages. Thanks to data abstraction, we can&#39;t tell how the phone itself transmits signals since the data abstraction style is only exposing the essential elements of a device.</p>

Student 12: <p>I think Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented architecture is the most common architectural style that is being used to build software. We can see many application that are using Object oriented architecture wherever we need to reuse the functionality or protect or abstract the data we will use Object oriented architecture style.  Also java follows the object oriented principle and java is used widely in industry so we can say that Object oriented architecture is the most common style.</p>
